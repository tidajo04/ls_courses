1. When starting a new project always create a virtual environment (see LS process at PY101 Programming foundations... Lesson 2:... 5.Python Virtual Environments)
    - I have set up a "env_d" as my GO-TO envirment using the most up to date version of python in the codespace

2. ALWAYS activate a virtual environment before starting any new project (this way if anything gets screwed up or makes global changes it wont affect the whole system)
    -to activate an env you created, use the following code in the ccommand terminal. 
        $ ~/.local/opt/python-3.9.20/bin/python3 -m venv ~/.venv/env_d
        $ source ~/.venv/env_d/bin/activate
            ***change the "env_d" (in both lines above) to whatever environment you previously created and want to use
        $ python --version 
            *** checks the version being used in the environment
3. INSTALL Pylint for every virtual environment you create 
    *** pylint help check your code and troubleshoot issues (as of now env_d has it installed)
    - may also need to create a '.pylintrc' file in the working directory so that you can configure the pylint as needed (see lesson 2 projects for a good example of what to fill the pylintrc with)
