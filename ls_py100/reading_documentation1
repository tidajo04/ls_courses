1. go to the PEP
2. use str.lower()
3. use r.just #format is: "stringlafsdgkjabkjv".rjust(#, 'char')
4. while there is no built in way to reverse a string, you can use slicing  (format is string[start:end:step])
    so string[::-1] will produce a reversed string.
5. by indexing a list[index number]
6. you can look up what the list index of a gfiven item in a list is by using the function list.index
7. if you look up an index and its outside the list you get an error 
8. you can write large ints by using underscores as would commas in natural language
9. use type(value) function to see what type of input you have
